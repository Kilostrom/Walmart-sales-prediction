# Walmart-sales-prediction

This is a group project but the developer of the code was done by me. 
A Manchine Learning application that look into previous Walmart sales data. Using that data to help make prediction of the upcoming year sales would be. Looking at what days it has the highest sales including holidays.

# What I learned 

•	Converting string date to date, handling missing values, feature engineering, data scaling, data splitting – training and testing set, feature selection, model training, and validation – Accuracy, F1 Score, precision, and recall
•	Model selection - Built a logistic and linear regression model on PyCharm using python.
•	Wrote a report and presentation talking about what data was used, model the data was built upon, what the code is doing, what the graph shows, and how would it be apply to in real time data.
