# Walmart-sales-prediction

This is a group project but the developer of the code was done by me. 
A Manchine Learning application that look into previous Walmart sales data. Using that data to help make prediction of the upcoming year sales would be. Looking at what days it has the highest sales including holidays.

# What I learned 

•	Converting string date to date, handling missing values, feature engineering, data scaling, data splitting – training and testing set, feature selection, model training, and validation – Accuracy, F1 Score, precision, and recall

•	Model selection - Built a logistic and linear regression model

• certain model works better for certain data set as how this project taught me how logistic regression is not the best choice compare to liner regression. Also, I could done a random forest with this too.
